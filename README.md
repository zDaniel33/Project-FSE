# Project-FSE
Management system for students at a university


We decided to pick the AGILE methodology because it offers flexibility.
We can code very quickly on a web application and that we can easily identify and correct errors,the issues identified and we can resolve them fast.
Since we are students and we use a similar app (Moodle) we can express our opinion and give feedback about our project by comparing them.
